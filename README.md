# ⌨️ Next.js Keyboard Key Press Detector

The Next.js Keyboard Key Press Detector is a simple web application that captures and displays keyboard input in real time. Built using Next.js and React, it leverages client-side rendering with hooks like useState and useEffect to listen for keydown events in the browser. When a user presses a key, the app immediately updates the display to show both the key value and its corresponding code, making it a practical tool for understanding keyboard interactions in web applications.

This project demonstrates effective event handling and dynamic state management in a React environment. With a minimalist and responsive design styled through inline CSS, the application provides clear and immediate feedback on user input, ensuring an intuitive and interactive experience for both developers and end users.
